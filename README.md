# Splunk Logging for Java

#### Version 1.11.5

Splunk logging for Java enables you to log events to HTTP Event Collector or to a TCP input on a Splunk Enterprise instance within your Java applications. You can use three major Java logging frameworks: [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch), [Log4j 2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), and [java.util.logging](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html). Splunk logging for Java is also enabled for [Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J)](http://www.slf4j.org).

Splunk logging for Java provides:

* Appender classes that package events into the proper format for the input type you're using (HTTP Event Collector or TCP).

* Handler classes that export the logging events.

* An optional error handler to catch failures for HTTP Event Collector events.

* Example configuration files for all three frameworks that show how to configure the frameworks to write to HTTP Event Collector or TCP ports.

* Support for batching events (sent to HTTP Event Collector only).</li>

### Requirements

Here's what you need to get going with Splunk logging for Java.
