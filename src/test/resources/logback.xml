      You should send data to Splunk using TCP inputs. You can find the documentation
      on how to open TCP inputs on Splunk at

          http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.0.1/Data/Monitornetworkports

      Logback does not ship with a usable appender for TCP sockets (its SocketAppender
      serializes Java objects for deserialization by a server elsewhere). Instead, use
      the TcpAppender provided with this library.

      This example assumes that you have Splunk running on your local machine (127.0.0.1) with a
      TCP input configured on port 15000. Note that TCP inputs are *not* the same as
      Splunk's management port.

      You can control the format of what is logged by changing the encoder (see

          http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#ClassicPatternLayout

      for details).
